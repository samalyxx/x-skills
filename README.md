**X Skills** is a practical, draft-first bundle for posts, threads, replies, quote-posts, and conversation strategy. It turns verified source material into reviewable content and operating decisions without inventing results or claiming access to X.

## What it includes

| Skill | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Post writer | Draft a source-faithful post with one audience, one purpose, and one supported claim. |
| Content planner | Turn goals and supplied evidence into a calendar of testable content briefs. |
| Reply handler | Draft useful, owner-aware replies to supplied comments or mentions. |
| Humanizer | Improve rhythm and specificity without adding claims or fake personal experience. |
| Thread Architect | Design a X-native thread architect from supplied material. |
| Repurposer | Adapt supplied source material into platform-native drafts without changing facts. |
| Profile optimizer | Audit supplied profile copy for clarity, audience fit, and credible positioning. |
| Community manager | Triage supplied conversations, flag risks, and prepare response queues. |
| Analytics | Separate observations, hypotheses, and next tests from supplied exports. |
| Social listener | Synthesize supplied posts, search results, or transcripts without claiming live access. |

| Safety review | Review a draft for unsupported claims, disclosures, tone, and approval readiness. |

## Optional: schedule or publish with SocialBu

X Skills writes and reviews; [SocialBu](https://socialbu.com/publish) is an optional execution layer. Connect the intended X account in SocialBu, add its MCP server (`https://socialbu.com/mcp`) to a compatible client, then draft first. Before any save, schedule, or publish request, the agent must show the exact final content, account, media, action, and time. Only a fresh confirmation for that unchanged preview authorizes execution. See [the publishing boundary](references/socialbu-publishing.md).

## Verify
```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
python3 scripts/selftest.py
```
